# Awesome-LLM4SVD 🌟-🧠👩‍💻🔍

This repository contains the artifacts from the systematic literature review (SLR) on LLM-based software vulnerability detection ("A Systematic Literature Review on Detecting Software Vulnerabilities with Large Language Models"). 
The SLR analyzes 227 studies published between January 2020 and June 2025 and provides a structured taxonomy of detection approaches, input representations, system architectures, adaptation techniques, and dataset usage.


## Table of Contents

To support open science and reproducibility, we publicly release:
- 📝 [Surveyed Papers](#papers): A curated list of surveyed papers. This list will be continuously updated to track the latest papers.
